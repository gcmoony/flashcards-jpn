# Flashcards - Japan Edition
Check it out [here](https://flashcards-jpn.netlify.app/)!
## What is this?
It's a way for someone like me to try building a React app, while also learning a little bit of Japanese. I created the JSON file for the flash cards, which for now only contains Hiragana and Katakana.
## What does it do
For now, it displays the Japanese character. When a card is clicked or tapped, the card will flip over to reveal the English character (pronounciation).
## Can I contribute?
Of course. Create an issue or pull request. I'd be happy to collaborate.
